        <h3>Origami comes from the Japanese. The word means the art of folding paper. "Ori" means "folding," and kami
            means
            "paper." In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices. The
            goal is
            to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting
            techniques.
